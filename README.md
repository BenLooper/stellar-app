After logging in you will see the game screen and user panel which will show your top 5 scores. Press 'START' to begin the game and use the arrow keys to move the monkey left, right, or straight ahead.

The game is over when the monkey falls. Your score is based on how many platforms you pass, and will be displayed to you after the game is over.

Feel free to play the game as many times as you like. If you get into the top 10 scores on your database your name will be displayed on the homepage!
